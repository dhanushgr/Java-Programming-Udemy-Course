Object Oriented Programming.

Encapsulation:
       * Refers to bundling data with methods that can operate on that data within a class.
       * Itâ€™s the idea of hiding data within a class, preventing anything outside that class directly interacting with it.
       * Keeps the programmer in control of access to data.
       * Prevents the programmer from ending up in any strange or unwanted states.
       * Can impement Throw and Catch block of code. 

Abstraction:
       * Refers to the idea to only showing essential details and keeping everything else hidden.
       * The classes you create should act like your car. Users of your classes should not worry 
       about the inner details of those classes.
       * This is very important when working on your program incrementally.
       
Inheritance:
       * Is the principle that allows classes to derive from other classes.
       * ParentClass and ChildClass/SubClass are present
       * public ClassName(which will be ChildClass) extends ParentClass
       * ChildClass has all the properties of ParentClass. You can run every functions of ParentClass by using ChildClass(use the object of ChildClass in MainMethod and try to do the fucntions of the ParentClass)

Polymorphism:
       * Describes methods that are able to take on many forms.
       * Allows methods to take on many different forms.
       * Be sure that you are calling the correct form of the method.
       * There are two types of polymorphism: 
              ** Dynamic polymorphism: 
                     - Occurs during the runtime of the program.
                     - Describes when a method signature is in both subclass and a superclass.
                     - The methods share the same name but have different implementation.
                     - The implementation of the subclass that the object is an instance of 
                     overrides that of the superclass.
              ** Static polymorphism:
                     -  Occurs during compile-time rather than during runtime.
                     -  Refers to when multiply methods with the same name but different arguments
                        are defined in the same class.
                     -  The parameters are different type or taken in different order.
                      -  This is known as method overloading.

Constructor:
       * It has the same name as the ClassName.
       * Don't have a return type.
       ClassName(){                //This is constructor. By default this Constructor will be present.
                                   
       }

       ClassName(int a, int b, int c){    //This is a Constructor with arguments
              this.a=a;
              this.b=b;                   //sets a local variable(variable form other class) as a member variable(Variable of this class)
              this.c=c;
       }



       * in Main method:
              You can directly pass a argument while defining a object. 
              That is called initial state of the obj.(In opps this is used commonly)
              If you dont specify a initial state, it will be not used and be as a junk value until the value is assigned.
       
       Member variable which is "this.speed"(in our eg) will have the 0 assigned to it initially. 

       * Once you mention a constructor with parameters in your class, dont forget to call the normal constructor will no parameter.
         because java will erase the normal constructor(which was present in there by default), when you create your own constructor.
       
       Good Practice is to mention both of the constructor when you create it.


Reference types:
        In "Class object = new Class()"
            * Classes are Reference types.
            * Objects of the classes are Reference variable.
        In "int i = 9;"
            * int is a primitive type
            * i is a primitive variable.


        Memory is stored in stack and heap.
            * Heap is globally shared.
            * Each method has a separate stack.
            * All new objects are created in the heap.

        primitive variables and reference variables are stored in stack.
            * Primitive variables store the value directly in the stack.
            * Reference variables store the reference of the memory location of the actual object is stored(Heap address.)
        whereas the reference type with parameter(actual object) is stored in the Heap.( Class(2) )
        class(2) and class(5) are two different objects. Both have two different address, which will be referred by the objects in the stack.

        Reference variables stores null , if nothing is assigned to it.
        If you assign a reference variable to another reference variable, then:
            * The address gets copied to the variable.
              If you change any of the things in that new variable then it gets reflected to the old variable,
              because it shares the same memory address.

        If you compare( a==b )
            two primitive variables, it compares the value in it.
            two reference variables, it compares if it is referring to the same object.


variable arguments:
        It is used in situations where if i want to output something according to the need of how many arguments are present.
        for eg:
            int sum(int i, int j){
                return i+j;
            }

            int sum(int i, int j, int k){
                return i+j+k;
            }

            Instead of writing these multiple methods with diff arguments with same functions. In these conditions
            we should use variable arguments.

            int sum(int... values){
                for(int value:values){
                    sum = sum + value;
                }
                return sum;
            }

            This code can take multiple arguments and do the work.


Super Class:
    This concept will occur when there is Inheritance in the project.
        super() class should be implemented in the constructor of the subclasses
        If you don't mention anything in the constructor of the subclass, java will implicitly call the super() class.
        You can always mention the super() class explicitly if you want.
        if a member variable is mandatory, then you will create the Constructor with the mandatory field (eg:If name of a person is mandatory, then
         you will construct "public customer(String name){...}" instead of "public customer(){}")
            * then, the default constructor which is "public customer(){}" will be deleted.
            * when this happens, either you should mention this default constructor by yourself. OR
            * mention "super(name)" in every constructor of the subclass.
            - Otherwise, you will get an error message.

Abstract:
    * Abstract class
    * Abstract methods

    - classes which are not abstract are called concrete class(normal class).

    Abstract class:
        - howToDefine: "public abstract class Animal{...}"
        - super(parent) class is defined as the abstract class on many occasions
        - You can't create objects from Abstract class.
        - eg:   If I have a Cat and Dog class which extends Animal class
                In this, I would like to have an object of Cat or Dog.
                But an Object of Animal class doesn't make sense. In this situation, using Abstract class is useful.

    Abstract Method:
        - howToDefine: public abstract void method();
        - Abstract methods are inside Abstract classes.
        - You just need to declare a method, but not define it in Abstract class

        - If you declare a Abstract method(in an Abstract class), then
          that method MUST be defined in every subclass that extends the super abstract class
          with a @Override as annotation in the definition of the method(in subclass)
        - Abstract method makes sure that every subclass should have that method.
        - If you don't want that class as a must in every subclass, then don't mention it as a abstract method


Interface:
    public interface interfaceClass{}
    public class Cat implements interfaceClass{}
    - by default every methods in interface are abstract.
      so, if you define any method in an interface that will be abstract.
      if cat uses the interfaceClass now, then that cat class MUST define the method in it(coz its abstract)

    Difference between Interface and Abstract are:
        Interface:  can implements as many class as it needs.
                    Every member variable in interface is "final" and "static"
        Abstract:   can only extend one class(multiple inheritance is not allowed in Java)
